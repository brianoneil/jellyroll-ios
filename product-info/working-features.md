### Theme Architecture
- Protocol-based theme system with light and dark variants
- Centralized `ThemeManager` with environment object injection
- Consistent color palette across the application:
  - Background colors (primary, surface, elevated surface)
  - Text hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary)
  - Accent colors and gradients
  - Semantic color properties for specific use cases
- Built-in support for:
  - Background gradients
  - Text gradients
  - Card styles
  - Overlay effects
- Theme persistence across app launches
- Automatic system theme synchronization

#### Theme Usage Guidelines
1. Always access theme properties through the `@EnvironmentObject` `themeManager`:
   ```swift
   @EnvironmentObject private var themeManager: ThemeManager
   // Use: themeManager.currentTheme.propertyName
   ```
2. Use semantic color properties instead of raw colors:
   - `backgroundColor` for main backgrounds
   - `surfaceColor` for elevated content
   - `primaryTextColor` for important text
   - `secondaryTextColor` for supporting text
   - `accentColor` for highlights and actions
3. For gradients, use the pre-defined gradient properties:
   - `backgroundGradient` for full-screen backgrounds
   - `accentGradient` for interactive elements
   - `textGradient` for emphasized text
   - `overlayGradient` for image overlays
4. Theme changes are handled automatically through the environment
5. new semantic color properties can be added to the theme manager for new use cases
6. new gradient properties can be added to the theme manager for new use cases
7. Never use raw colors in the code, always use the semantic color properties
