- [x] Create adaptive layout grid for different screen sizes
- [x] Add padding system for content areas based on device orientation
- [x] Implement safe area handling for notched devices
- [x] Create utility functions for dynamic spacing calculations

### 4. Visual Hierarchy Enhancement
**File**: `jellyroll-2/Features/Home/Views/HomeView.swift`  
**Overview**: Optimize the visual hierarchy for mobile contexts.

- [x] Implement progressive disclosure pattern for complex content
- [x] Add emphasis scaling for important UI elements
- [x] Create focus states for active content areas
- [x] Implement visual grouping for related content
- [x] Add depth system for layered interface elements
- [x] Create prominence scale for different content types

### 5. Interactive Element Optimization
**File**: `jellyroll-2/Features/Library/Views/MovieCard.swift`  
**Overview**: Perfect touch interactions and affordances.

- [x] Add haptic feedback patterns for different interaction types
- [x] Implement gesture recognition zones with visual indicators
- [x] Create press states with appropriate visual feedback
- [x] Add interaction ripple effects for touch feedback
- [x] Implement edge swipe detection with visual hints
- [x] Create bounce-back animations for limits

### 6. Enhanced Visual Feedback
**File**: `jellyroll-2/Features/Playback/Views/VideoPlayerView.swift`  
**Overview**: Implement sophisticated feedback system.

- [x] Add loading state animations with progress indication
- [x] Implement success/error state transitions
- [x] Create micro-interactions for UI state changes
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [x] Implement smooth state transitions
- [x] Create custom success/error animations

### 7. Gestural Interface Enhancement
**File**: `jellyroll-2/Features/Library/Views/SeriesDetailView.swift`  
**Overview**: Implement clear gestural affordances.

- [x] Add pull-to-refresh with custom animation
- [x] Implement swipe-to-dismiss gesture
- [x] Create pinch-to-zoom functionality
- [x] Add swipe actions for list items
- [x] Implement scroll-to-top gesture
- [x] Create custom gesture animations

### 8. Content Density Optimization
**File**: `jellyroll-2/Features/Library/Views/SeriesGridView.swift`  
**Overview**: Perfect the balance of information density.

- [x] Implement adaptive grid layouts based on screen size
