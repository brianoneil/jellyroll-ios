Coding best practices 

- Try to keep views and components discrete and in their own file when creating new components.  This will help them stay maintainable. 
- Don't update existing components unless it is absolutely necessary or you are specifically asked to do so. 
- Ensure there is good exception handling in methods
- Alway comment complex code areas with easy to follow information about it
- Make common code resuable within the application code base
- Use existing types and define interfaces to promote reuse in the application
